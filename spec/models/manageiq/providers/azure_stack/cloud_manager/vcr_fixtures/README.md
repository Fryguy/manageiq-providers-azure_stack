# VCR fixtures for Azure Stack
This directory contains Azure Stack deployments that VCR cassettes were
recorded against. If you need to re-record the cassette, just deploy the JSON
file into a resource group named `demo-resource-group` and you'll get similar
setup as the one used for original recording.
